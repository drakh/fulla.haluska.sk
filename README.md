Geometric Toy - Fulla at Hackathon 2014 in Slovak National Gallery.

Created by Zden Hlinka using outputs from his Geometric Photo Filter.
(developing version to be released in near future allowing better geometric control)
All images are based on paitings of Lubovit Fulla.
Tearing Cloth by Sufflick was modified to create this small viewer capable
to map vector images on cloth model. Thanks a lot for this amazing straightforward
piece of physics modelling code.
